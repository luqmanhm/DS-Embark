Repo for my early phase mini projects into Data Science.

MINI PROJECT 1\
Detection of fraud in credit card transactions (2013, European cardholders) based on data obtained from Kaggle.com through the Machine Learning Group â€“ ULB. Dataset size of 284,807. Dataset was found to be imbalanced (pre-processed by scaling, distributing, and data split), therefore over-sampling (SMOTE) must be done to compensate. Correlation matrices are done through data visualisation (heat map). Models Random Forest & XGBoost gave the best results (F1 score: 0.87 and 0.85, respectively).\
