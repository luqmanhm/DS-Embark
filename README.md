Repo for my early phase mini projects into Data Science.

MINI PROJECT 1
Detection of fraud in credit card transactions (2013, European cardholders) based on data obtained from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) through the Machine Learning Group â€“ ULB. Dataset size of 284,807. Dataset was found to be imbalanced (pre-processed by scaling, distributing, data split), therefore over-sampling (SMOTE) must be done to compensate.
